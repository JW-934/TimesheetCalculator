# FinalCS1: TimesheetCalc

This program will ask for the user's hourly wage and take a file called hours.txt containing their work hours for each day of the week and the amount of each (weekly) paycheck. It will then generate a file called output.txt containing the number of hours, the amount they made in all each week, how much of it was removed for taxes/fees, the average weekly fees, and which week had the highest fees.
