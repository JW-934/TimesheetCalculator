/**
 * This is my final project for CS 141, it will ask for the user's hourly wage and take a file called hours.txt containing their work hours for each 
 * day of the week and the amount of each (weekly) paycheck. It will then generate a file called output.txt containing the number of hours, the amount 
 * they made in all each week, how much of it was removed for taxes/fees, the average weekly fees, and which week had the highest fees (indicating union dues etc.).
